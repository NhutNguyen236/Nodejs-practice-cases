# 🎉 Welcome to some of my NodeJS practice cases 🎉

## ⚠️ Things to do before we get started
- As you can see, all those cases are separated on purpose that you can break them out like you just want that `Simple-CRUD` so just go ahead and [DownGit](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home) it, everything is ready for you.
- Next thing, please please, `npm install` first to get that `package-lock.json` back and you are now ready to run.
